# Challenge 3: Code Analysis with GitHub

In this challenge, I analyzed source code repositories on GitHub to identify vulnerabilities and extract sensitive information.

## Description:
Reviewed a sample source code repository on GitHub and identified potential vulnerabilities or sensitive information.

## Instructions:
1. Visited the provided GitHub repository [here](link-to-github-repo).
2. Analyzed the source code for vulnerabilities, security flaws, or sensitive information.
3. Documented any vulnerabilities or insights discovered during the analysis.
4. Shared my findings and analysis report with the organizers.

## Files:
- `source_code_repo/`: Sample repository for code analysis.
- `vulnerabilities_report.md`: Vulnerabilities and analysis report.

Happy analyzing!
